## Add loot boxes to your server!

Using this plugin, players can find or be given loot boxes which contain rewards you configure.

**UI support coming soon!**

*This plugin is made for [OpenMod](https://openmod.github.io/openmod-docs/), the successor of RocketMod. OpenMod supports all RocketMod plugins. [Migrate to OpenMod now](https://openmod.github.io/openmod-docs/user-guide/installation/unturned/). Feel free to ask questions in the [OpenMod Discord](https://discord.gg/6yy7gxk).*

### Usage

Players can naturally find these loot boxes by doing a range of normal activities in the game. Check out the **Configuration** section for more details.

Loot boxes can also be directly given to players for use in donation systems and other custom applications.

### Commands

- /unbox `<box>` - Unbox a loot box.
  Requires the `DropBoxes:commands.unbox` permission.
	
- /boxes - View your loot boxes.
  Requires the `DropBoxes:commands.boxes` permission.
	
- /givebox `<player> <box>` - Give an online player a loot box.
  Requires the `DropBoxes:commands.givebox` permission.

### Configuration

```
# Each loot box has a configuration.
# BoxId - The unique id for this loot box. Used for storing in the database.
# Name - The display name for this loot box. This is displayed to the user.
# Permission - The permission needed for naturally receiving this loot box. Naturally refers
#   to receiving via one of the chances below. Players without this permission can still
#   receive via the /givebox command and can open previously acquired loot boxes.
#   ** This setting is optional, you can remove this line in the config.
# Chances - The chances related to finding this loot box.
#   PlayerKill - The chance a player will receive this loot box when killing a player.
#   ZombieKill - The chance a player will receive this loot box when killing a zombie.
#   MegaZombieKill - The chance a player will receive this loot box when killing a mega zombie.
#   AnimalKill - The chance a player will receive this loot box when killing an animal.
#   HarvestPlant - The chance a player will receive this loot box when harvesting a plant.
#   HarvestResource - The chance a player will receive this loot box when finishing harvesting a resource.
# Rewards - The rewards possibly given when finding this loot box.
#   Only one reward will be given to the player. The reward is chosen based on the
#   configured weights of each reward. Three items with weights of 2, 4, and 8 all
#   have the same chances as if their weights were 20, 40, and 80 instead.
#   Item - The id or name of the reward item. If this is a number, it will search for the id first.
#   Weight - The weighting this reward has as described above.
